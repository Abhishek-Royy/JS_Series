* Loops are used to execute a piece of code again and again
There are multiple Loops in our code:-
                    for Loop
                    while Loop
                    do-while Loop

* Infinite Loop: A loop that never ends.

* `while Loop`
    initialization:
    while(condition){
        updation & others works.
    }

* `do-while Loop`
    do{
        updation & others Works.
    }
    while(condition);

** `There was no semicolon used in at the end of while loop`
** `There was a semicolon used after (do-while),while Loop`

* `for in loop`
    it return the `key` from an object.
